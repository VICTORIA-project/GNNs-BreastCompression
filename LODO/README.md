## Dataset Generation and running the experiment:
1. Run `dataset_full.py`, generating graph data for the 10 distinct batches of directions for the 29-time steps and single graph data for the final step #30.
2. Run `pg_dataset.py`, transforming the generated graph data of the 29-time steps into NetworkX graphs, converting them to PyTorch Geometric format, and storing the result as a .pickle file. For each batch [a,b,c,...,j] this is done separately by uncommenting the corresponding path.
3. Run `pg_dataset_single.py` to transform the graph data generated by the final step and store the result as a .pickle file.
4. Run `main_single.py`, to start the training. The 3rd configuration of the PhysGNN models is used.
5. Run `reproduce_single.py`, to reproduce the quantitative results on the test set.
